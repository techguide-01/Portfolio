            <p>Field Study 1 - Observations of Teaching – Learning Actual School Environment</p>
            <p>This is the first experiential course, which will immerse a future teacher in an actual classroom situation and learning environment where direct observation of teaching-learning episodes that focus on the application of educational theories learned in content and pedagogy courses will be made. Observation on learner’s behavior, motivation, and teacher’s strategies of teaching, classroom management, and assessment in learning among others shall be given emphasis. This course is meant to assist field study students in verifying their conduct in the actual learning environment. It will necessitate them recognizing possible ways to facilitate learning while considering the learner's various stages of development and social surroundings.</p>

                <h1 class="title">Reflection</h1>
                <p>As a future teacher, I am excited to embark on my journey into the world of education. I have always been passionate about learning and teaching, and I believe that I have the skills and knowledge to make a positive impact on the lives of my students.</p>
                <p>My reflections on the four episodes have given me a deeper understanding of what it means to be an effective teacher. I have learned about the importance of creating a positive learning environment, using a variety of teaching strategies, and engaging students in active learning. I have also learned about the importance of being patient, understanding, and supportive.</p>
                <p>I am grateful for the opportunity to have learned from Mr. Daguplo. He is an exemplary teacher who has inspired me to strive for excellence in my own teaching. I am confident that I can use the lessons I have learned from him to make a difference in the lives of my students.</p>
                <h1>Here are some of the key takeaways from my reflections:</h1>
                <li>The importance of creating a positive learning environment: A positive learning environment is one where students feel safe, respected, and supported. It is a place where students feel comfortable taking risks and making mistakes.</li>
                <li>The importance of using a variety of teaching strategies: There is no one-size-fits-all approach to teaching. Different students learn in different ways, so it is important to use a variety of teaching strategies to reach all learners.</li>
                <li>The importance of engaging students in active learning: Active learning is when students are actively involved in the learning process. This can be done through hands-on activities, group discussions, and real-world applications.</li>
                <li>The importance of being patient, understanding, and supportive: Students learn at their own pace, and it is important to be patient with them. It is also important to be understanding and supportive, and to provide encouragement and motivation.</li>
                <p>I am excited to use the lessons I have learned from my reflections to become an effective teacher. I believe that I have the skills and knowledge to make a positive impact on the lives of my students.</p>
